    <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Building software means to provide tools for everyone. I enjoy creating software that helps people in one way or another.</p>
        <p>I always liked science, math, and technical things as a kid, but I didn't get into software engineering until I was in college. 
        After seeing how much I enjoyed it, I decided to major in computer science and earned an undergraduate degree from Saint Johnâ€™s University. 
        After getting my bachelors degree, I went to work for a rapidly growing and fast paced NYC tech startup where I worked on everything 
        from XML and data transfer, to DOM manipulation and web development. Then, I moved on to work for a publishing company 
        which provides literacy programs for kids, where I started as a web developer working on a Magento e-commerce site. 
        After quickly mastering object-oriented programming concepts, modern software tools and frameworks, I joined an internal tools team as a software engineer. </p>
        <p>Now, I build software that helps with production of electronic eBooks and publishing them to an online platform where eBooks can be viewed and used in classrooms 
        by students and teachers all around the country. I work mostly in Python, PHP and JavaScript. Check out my portfolio and perhaps we can work together soon.</p>
